11. Training and Building the model
12. Comparing the models with accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, AUC, Specificity and Sensitivity
13. Comparison graphs are generated with scores of all models.

FrontEnd
--------

14. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
15. For the frontend we used the data for predicting the Intrusion Attack Detection 
16. User gives input as Feature Values 
17. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
18. Trained model is used for prediction
19. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use Hybrid of ANN + CNN + LSTM and RNN model for analysis the dataset and got 97% of accuracy
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as CNN + LSTM + GRU and CNN + BiLSTM + GRU, may get 97% or above
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
